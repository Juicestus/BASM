# BASM
BASM stands for "Bad Assembly Language" and is an esoteric programming language.\
BASM is designed to be a challange to write, but not too hard to the point where it isn't fun.\
BASM consists of many improvments off previous language K0D3 which make it just useable.

## How to build
I wrote the build system in Python because, as quoted in the actual script:
```python
# I use Python for build systems as an alternative
# to shell scripts, Make, and CMake because, despite
# being an actual language, it is easier to write 
# and understable than said alternatives.
```

A Python interpreter of version 3.6 or newer is required to build.\
The C/C++ compilers are editable in the file, but it is setup to use gcc/g++ and to build on MacOS or Linux.

To build and clean, run: ```./build.py build clean```\
The resulting binary located at ```bin/basm```
